### What information do I need to provide to the lawyer when I am purchasing a property ?

1 -- The first and foremost information we need from you is to know who you are.

2 -- We need a copy of your agreement.

3 -- If you are buying a condo, we would need a copy of the Status Certificate as well.

4 -- We need to know who is providing the mortgage for your purchase.

5 -- We would need the name of the lawyer for the seller so we can communicate with them to facilitate the transaction.
